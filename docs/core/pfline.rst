======
PfLine
======

The basic building block of the ``portfolyo`` package is the "portfolio line" (``PfLine``). Instances of this class store a timeseries containing volume information, price information, or both. This page discusses their most important properties, and how to use them.

For a tutorial, :doc:`see here <../tutorial/index>`.

It is assumed that you are familiar with the following dimension abbrevations: ``w`` for power, ``q`` for energy, ``p`` for price, and ``r`` for revenue; see :doc:`this page for more information <../specialized_topics/dimensions>`.

----
Kind
----

An important characteristic of a portfolio line is its "kind". The property ``PfLine.kind`` has a value from the ``portfolyo.Kind`` enumeration and tells us the type of information it contains:

* ``Kind.VOLUME``: "volume-only" portfolio line.

  This is a portfolio line that only contains volume information. 
  
  As an example, consider the expected/projected development of offtake volume of a customer or customer group.

  The volume in each timestamp can be retrieved by the user in units of energy (e.g., MWh) or in units of power (e.g., MW).

* ``Kind.PRICE``: "price-only" portfolio line.

  This is a portfolio line which only contains price information. 
  
  For example, the forward price curve for a certain market area, or the fixed offtake price that a customer is paying for a certain delivery period.

* ``Kind.REVENUE``: "revenue-only" portfolio line.

  For example, the payoff of a financially-settled put option, which has a monetary value (e.g., in Eur) without an associated volume being delivered.

* ``Kind.COMPLETE``

  This a portfolio line that contains volume, price and revenue information. 
  
  For example: the volume that has been sourced to hedge a certain portfolio, e.g. in monthly or quarterly blocks. 

  For each timestamp we have a volume (the contracted volume, both as energy and as power), a price (for which the volume was contracted) and a revenue (i.e., the multiplication of the energy and the price). 

"Volume-only" and "complete" portfolio lines contain redundant information. For the volume, the power (in MW) can be calculated by dividing the energy (in MWh) by the duration of the timestamp (in h). Likewise, the price (in Eur/MWh) can be calculated by dividing the revenue (in Eur) by the energy (in MWh). See also the note in the next section.

--------------
Initialisation 
--------------

There are many ways to specify the timeseries from which to initialise a portfolio line; here we will discuss the most common ones. In all cases it is assumed that :doc:`the data has been prepared and standardized<../specialized_topics/dataprep>`.

In General
==========

``portfolyo`` tries to determine the dimension of information (e.g., if it is a price or a volume) using its key (if it has one) and its unit (also, if it has one) - see the section on :ref:`Compatilibity of abbrevation and unit <nameunitcompatibility>`.

To initialise a volume-only / price-only / revenue-only portfolio line, we must only provide a volume / price / revenue timeseries. To initialise a complete portfolio line, we must supply at least 2 of the following timeseries: prices, volumes, revenues. 

.. note::
   
   Specifying volumes: it is not necessary to specify both power (``w``) and energy (``q``); for a given timestamp we can calculate one from the other. If both *are* specified, they should be consistent with each other. 

   Specifying volumes and prices: the same goes when specifying volume (either ``w`` or ``q``), price (``p``) and revenue (``r``). Only two are needed, and if more *are* specified, they should be consistent.


DataFrame or dictionary of timeseries...
========================================

or any other ``Mapping`` from (string) key values to ``pandas.Series``. 

The keys (or dataframe column names) must each be one of the following: ``w`` (power), ``q`` (energy), ``p`` (price), ``r`` (revenue). Depending on the keys, the ``.kind`` of the portfolio line is determined.

.. exec_code::
   
   import portfolyo as pf 
   import pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
   input_dict = {'w': pd.Series([200, 220, 300.0], index)}
   pf.PfLine(input_dict)
   # --- hide: start ---
   print(repr(pf.PfLine(input_dict)))

Timeseries with unit
====================

Under the condition that a valid ``pint`` unit is present, we may also provide a single timeseries (``pandas.Series``), or an iterable of timeseries. They are automatically converted to the default unit.

.. exec_code::

   # --- hide: start ---
   import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
   # --- hide: stop ---
   # using the imports and index from the previous example
   input_series = pd.Series([10, 11.5, 10.8], index, dtype='pint[ctEur/kWh]')
   pf.PfLine(input_series)
   # --- hide: start ---
   print(repr(pf.PfLine(input_series)))
   

Dictionary of portfolio lines...
================================

or any other ``Mapping`` from (string) key values to ``PfLine`` objects. 

The keys are used as the children names: 

.. exec_code::

   # --- hide: start ---
   import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
   # --- hide: stop ---
   pfl1 = pf.PfLine(pd.Series([0.2, 0.22, 0.3], index, dtype='pint[GW]')) 
   pfl2 = pf.PfLine(pd.Series([100, 150, 200.0], index, dtype='pint[MW]')) 
   dict_of_children = {'southeast': pfl1, 'northwest': pfl2}
   pfl = pf.PfLine(dict_of_children)
   # --- hide: start ---
   print(repr(pf.PfLine(dict_of_children)))

Note that the aggregate values are shown. 

Nesting is not limited to one level, and, instead of having each value be a ``PfLine`` objects, it is actually sufficient that each value can be used to initialise a ``PfLine`` object. 
  

--------------
Flat or Nested
--------------

As seen in the final initialisation example, we can create *nested* portfolio lines, where a portfolio line contains one or more named children (which are also portfolio lines). This in contrast to the *'flat'* portfolio lines we created in the first initialisation example. 

.. note:: When checking the types, you will see that these are actually different classes. The flat portfolio line is an instance of the ``FlatPfLine`` class, whereas the portfolio line which has nesting is an instance of the ``NestedPfLine`` class. Both are descendents of the ``PfLine`` base class. When initialising a ``PfLine``, the correct type will be returned based on the input data. 

For nested portfolio lines, we are always looking at and working with the the top level, i.e., the sum/aggregate - unless explicitly stated otherwise by the user.

An example of where a nested portfolio line makes sense, is to combine procurement on the forward market and spot trade into a "sourced" portfolio line. We can then easily work with the aggregate values, but the values of the individual markets are also still available.

It is important to note that both types of portfolio line contain the exact same methods and properties that are described in the rest of this document. The nested portfolio lines have a few additional methods which are described now.

Working with children
=====================

The following common operations on nested portfolio lines are implemented:

* We can access a particular child by using its name as an index, e.g. ``pfl['southeast']``. If it does not collide with any of the attribute names, we can also access it by attribute, e.g. ``pfl.southeast``.

* We can iterate over all children with ``for name in pfl`` or ``for (name, child) in pfl.items()``.

* We can add a new child to a portfolio with ``pfl_new = pfl.set_child('southwest', ...)``. this returns a reference to the new object; the original object is unchanged. (It is immutable by design.)

* Likewise, we can remove a child from the portfolio with ``pfl_new = pfl.drop_child('southeast')``. At least one child should remain.

* If we are no longer interested in the particulars of each child, we can keep only the top-level information with the ``.flatten()`` method, which returns a flattened copy of the object.

  Note that a portfolio line may quietly be flattened whenever an operation is done that is ambiguous or undefined for a portfolio line with children. See the section on arithmatic_ below.


--------------
Accessing data
--------------

In order to get our data out of a portfolio line, the following options are available.

Timeseries
==========

The properties ``PfLine.w``, ``.q``, ``.p`` and ``.r`` always return the information as a ``pandas.Series``. These have a ``pint`` unit, which can be stripped using ``.pint.m`` (or ``.pint.magnitude``).

.. exec_code::

   # --- hide: start --- 
   # --- hide: stop ---
   import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
   input_df = pd.DataFrame({'w':[200, 220, 300], 'p': [100, 150, 200]}, index)
   pfl = pf.PfLine(input_df)
   
   pfl.r
   # --- hide: start ---
   print(repr(pfl.r))

.. Comment: the output of the line above may contain a central dot "pint[MWÂ·h]" which may cause some encoding problems for the output.

.. Comment: #TODO: Link to reference for more information

DataFrame
=========

If we want to extract more than one timeseries, we can use the ``.df()`` method, which has several options to control the exact format and contents of the dataframe. 

.. exec_code::

   # --- hide: start ---
   import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
   input_df = pd.DataFrame({'w':[200, 220, 300], 'p': [100, 150, 200]}, index)
   pfl = pf.PfLine(input_df)
   # --- hide: stop ---
   # continuation of previous code example
   pfl.df(units=False)
   # --- hide: start ---
   print('\n' + repr(pfl.df(units=False)))
   # --- hide: stop ---


.. Comment: #TODO: Link to reference for more information

Index
=====

The ``PfLine.index`` property returns the ``pandas.DatetimeIndex`` that applies to the data. This includes the frequency that tells us how long the time periods are that start at each of the timestamps in the index. 

.. exec_code::

   # --- hide: start --- 
   import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
   input_df = pd.DataFrame({'w':[200, 220, 300], 'p': [100, 150, 200]}, index)
   pfl = pf.PfLine(input_df)
   # --- hide: stop ---
   # continuation of previous code example
   pfl.index
   # --- hide: start ---
   print(repr(pfl.index))

For convenience, ``portfolyo`` adds a ``.duration`` and a ``right`` property to the ``pandas.DatetimeIndex`` class, which do as we would predict:

.. exec_code::

   # --- hide: start --- 
   import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
   input_df = pd.DataFrame({'w':[200, 220, 300], 'p': [100, 150, 200]}, index)
   pfl = pf.PfLine(input_df)
   # --- hide: stop ---
   # continuation of previous code example
   pfl.index.duration, pfl.index.right
   # --- hide: start ---
   print(repr(pfl.index.duration),'\n', repr(pfl.index.right))



Index slice
===========

From ``pandas`` we know the ``.loc[]`` property which allows us to select a slice of the objects. This is implemented also for portfolio lines. Currently, it supports enering a slice of timestamps. It is a wrapper around the ``pandas.DataFrame.loc[]`` property, and therefore follows the same convention, with the end point being included in the result.

.. exec_code::

   # --- hide: start ---
   import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
   input_df = pd.DataFrame({'w':[200, 220, 300], 'p': [100, 150, 200]}, index)
   pfl = pf.PfLine(input_df)
   # --- hide: stop ---
   # continuation of previous code example
   pfl.loc['2024':'2025']
   # --- hide: start ---
   print(pfl.loc['2024':'2025'])
   # --- hide: stop ---


Volume-only, price-only or revenue-only
=======================================

With the ``.volume``, ``.price`` and ``.revenue`` properties, we are able to extract the specified data from a complete portfolio line. The returned ``PfLine`` is flat, as keeping the children would lead to incorrect values in some situations (in case we want to get the price part of a complete portfolio line - in that case, the aggregate price is the average of the children's prices, *weighted with their volumes* - which we lose if we keep only the prices).

Further below, in the section on arithmatic_, we see the reverse operation: combining two portfolio lines into a complete one.

----------------------------
Plotting / Excel / Clipboard
----------------------------

There are several ways to get data into other formats. 

Plotting
========

The data can be shown graphically with the ``.plot()`` method:

.. exec_code::

   # --- hide: start ---
   import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
   pfl = pf.PfLine(pd.DataFrame({'w':[200, 220, 300], 'p': [100, 150, 200]}, index))
   # --- hide: stop ---
   # continuation of previous code example
   pfl.plot()
   # --- hide: start ---
   pfl.plot().savefig('docs/savefig/fig_plot_pfl.png')

.. image:: ../savefig/fig_plot_pfl.png


Excel and clipboard
===================

Often, further data analyses are done in Excel. If you have a Workbook open, the easiest way is to copy the portfolio line data to the clipboard with the ``.to_clipboard()`` method. From there, it can be pasted onto a worksheet.

Alternatively, the data can be saved as an Excel workbook with the ``.to_excel()`` method.

.. code-block::

   # continuation of previous code example
   pfl.to_clipboard()
   pfl.to_excel("sourced_volume.xlsx")

.. image:: ../savefig/excel_output_pfl.png

----------
Resampling
----------

Using the ``.asfreq()`` method, we can quickly and correctly downsample our data, e.g. to monthly or yearly values. For price-and-volume portfolio lines, the prices are weighted with the energy as one would expect:

.. exec_code::

   # --- hide: start ---
   import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
   pfl = pf.PfLine(pd.DataFrame({'w':[200, 220, 300], 'p': [100, 150, 200]}, index))
   # --- hide: stop ---
   # continuation of previous code example
   pfl.asfreq('QS')
   # --- hide: start ---
   print(repr(pfl.asfreq('QS')))

For more information about resampling in general, see :doc:`this page<../specialized_topics/resampling>`.


.. _arithmatic: 

----------
Arithmatic
----------

There are many ways to change and interact with ``PfLine`` instances. An intuitive way is through arithmatic, described below. The operations are grouped by the operator, and colors are used to more easily indicate the type of the output value.

General remarks:

* The operands are defined liberally. E.g. "price" means any object that can be interpreted as a price: a single ``pint.Quantity`` with a valid price unit; a ``pandas.Series`` with a ``pint`` unit of price, a dictionary with a single key ``"p"``, a ``pandas.Dataframe`` with a single column ``"p"``, or a price-only portfolio line; see :doc:`interoperability`. 

  The following code example shows a few equivalent operations.

  .. exec_code::

     import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
     index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
     pfl = pf.PfLine(pd.Series([2, 2.2, 3], index, dtype='pint[MW]')) 
     pfl_1 = pfl + {'q': 50.0}
     pfl_2 = pfl + pf.Q_(50000.0, 'kWh')
     pfl_3 = pfl + {'q': pd.Series([50, 50, 50.0], index)}
     pfl_4 = pfl + pf.PfLine({'q': pd.Series([50, 50, 50.0], index)})
     pfl_1 == pfl_2 == pfl_3 == pfl_4
     # --- hide: start ---
     print(repr(pfl_1 == pfl_2 == pfl_3 == pfl_4))

* A single value is understood to apply uniformly to each timestamp in the index of the portfolio line.

* When doing arithmatic with a flat portfolio line, the result is again a flat portfolio line.

* When doing arithmatic with a nested portfolio line, the children are also present in the result. 

* Arithmatic does not do silent conversions, and raises an ``Exception`` in case of ambiguity. E.g.:
  
  - When adding a ``float`` value to a ``PRICE`` portfolio line. Instead, use the value to create a ``pint.Quantity`` using ``pf.Q_()``. 

  - Some operations are only possible if one or both of the operands is flat. A nested portfolio line can be flattened with the ``.flatten()`` method. 

* The usual relationship between addition and multiplication holds. E.g., for a given portfolio line ``pfl``, the following two calculations have the same return value: ``pfl + pfl`` and ``2 * pfl``.

Addition and subtraction
========================

* Addition and subtraction are only possible between operands of similar dimenions. E.g., to a price-only portfolio line, a price can be added, but not e.g. a volume. 

* Even if the both operands have the same dimension, they must both be nested or both be flat. E.g., a flat price can be added to a flat price-only portfolio line, but not to a nested price-only portfolio line. Two nested price-only portfolio lines can be added.

Here are several examples.

* Adding a volume to a volume-only portfolio line: 

  .. exec_code::
       
     import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
     index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
     vol = pf.PfLine(pd.Series([4, 4.6, 3], index, dtype='pint[MW]'))
     vol + pf.Q_(10, 'GWh')
     # --- hide: start ---
     print(repr(vol + pf.Q_(10, 'GWh')))
  
* When adding (or subtracting) two nested portfolio lines, the children are merged: 

  .. exec_code::
       
     # --- hide: start ---
     import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
     index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
     # --- hide: stop ---
     # continuation of previous code example
     vol_2 = pf.PfLine({
         'A': pd.Series([4, 4.6, 3], index, dtype='pint[MW]'), 
         'B': pd.Series([1, -1.8, 1.9], index, dtype='pint[MW]')
     }) 
     vol_3 = pf.PfLine({
         'B': pd.Series([0.5, 0.2, 1.9], index, dtype='pint[MW]'), 
         'C': pd.Series([2, 2.2, 3.8], index, dtype='pint[MW]')
     }) 
     diff = vol_2 - vol_3
  
     print([name for name in diff])
     diff['B']
     # --- hide: start ---
     print('')
     print(repr(diff['B']))
  
* We cannot add a flat and a nested portfolio line... 

  .. exec_code::
       
     # --- hide: start ---
     import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
     index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
     vol = pf.PfLine(pd.Series([4, 4.6, 3], index, dtype='pint[MW]'))
     vol_2 = pf.PfLine({
         'A': pd.Series([4, 4.6, 3], index, dtype='pint[MW]'),

     # continuation of previous code example
     # vol + vol_2  # raises Error
     # --- hide: start ---
     # print(repr(vol + vol_2))

  but must either flatten the nested one (and the result is a flat portfolio line)...

  .. exec_code::
       
     # --- hide: start ---
     import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
     index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
     vol = pf.PfLine(pd.Series([4, 4.6, 3], index, dtype='pint[MW]'))
     vol_2 = pf.PfLine({
         'A': pd.Series([4, 4.6, 3], index, dtype='pint[MW]'), 
         'B': pd.Series([1, -1.8, 1.9], index, dtype='pint[MW]')
     })      
     # --- hide: stop ---
     # continuation of previous code example
     vol + vol_2.flatten()
     # --- hide: start ---
     print(repr(vol + vol_2.flatten()))

  or we must give the flat one a name (and the result is a nested portfolio line)...

  .. exec_code::
       
     # --- hide: start ---
     import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
     index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='AS', periods=3)
     vol = pf.PfLine(pd.Series([4, 4.6, 3], index, dtype='pint[MW]'))
     vol_2 = pf.PfLine({
         'A': pd.Series([4, 4.6, 3], index, dtype='pint[MW]'), 
         'B': pd.Series([1, -1.8, 1.9], index, dtype='pint[MW]')
     })      
     # --- hide: stop ---
     # continuation of previous code example
     vol_2 + {'D': vol}
     # --- hide: start ---
     print(repr(vol_2 + {'D': vol}))


Scaling
=======

We can scale a portfolio line by multiplication with / division by a dimensionless (e.g. ``float``) value. 

* This applied to flat and nested portfolio line, regardless of the kind.

* The result is a portfolio line of the same kind.

* If the portfolio line is nested, the scaling applies to all children.

* For complete portfolio lines, the volume and revenue are scaled, while the price remains unchanged.

Negation is implemented as multiplication with -1.

.. _calcratio:

Calculating ratio 
=================

We can calculate the ratio of two portfolyo lines by dividing them.

* The portfolio lines must both be flat, and of the same kind.

* The result is a dimensionless ``pandas.Series``.

* None of the operands may be nested. First ``.flatten()`` if necessary. 

* None of the operands may be a complete portfolio line. First select the ``.volume``, ``.price`` or ``.revenue`` if necessary.

.. _changekind:

Changing kind
=============

We can turn one kind of portfolio line into another kind, by multiplying with or division by the correct (third) kind. 

* Concrete, because price * volume = revenue, we have these possibilities:

   - Multiplying a volume portfolio line with a price portfolio line results in a revenue portfolio line.
   
   - Dividing a revenue portfolio line by a price portfolio line results in a volume portfolio line.

   - Dividing a revenue portfolio line by a volume portfolio line results in a price portfolio line.

* At most one of the operands may be nested. First ``.flatten()`` if necessary.

* If one of the operands is nested, the value of the flat operand is combined with each child of the nested one. 

* None of the operands may be a complete portfolio line. First select the ``.volume``, ``.price`` or ``.revenue`` if necessary.

* To combine two portfolio lines into a complete portfolio line, see the section :ref:`union`, below.

Union into complete portfolio line
==================================

We can combine portfolio lines of distinct kind into a complete portfolio line. We use the union operator ``|`` for this.

* None of the operands may be a complete portfolio line. First select the ``.volume``, ``.price`` or ``.revenue`` if necessary.

* At most one of the operands may be nested. First ``.flatten()`` if necessary.

* If both operands are flat portfolio lines, the result is a flat complete portfolio line. Both operands must be volume-only, price-only, or revenue-only.

* If one of the operands is nested, the flat operand is combined with each of its children. Both operands must be volume-only or price-only.

.. _`â¥1fâ `:

  Both operands must be flat.

Example with flat portfolio lines:

.. exec_code::
     
   # --- hide: start ---  
   import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='MS', periods=3)
   vol = pf.PfLine(pd.Series([100, 250, 100], index, dtype='pint[MW]')) 
   # --- hide: stop ---
   # continuation of previous code example
   vol | pf.Q_(100, 'Eur/MWh')  # union with price results in complete portfolio line
   # --- hide: start ---
   print(repr(vol | pf.Q_(100, 'Eur/MWh')))

Combining a nested volume portfolio line with a flat price:

.. exec_code::

   import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024', freq='MS', periods=3)
   # volumes
   existing_customers = pd.Series([250, 250, 250], index, dtype='pint[MW]') 
   expected_churn = pd.Series([-10, -15, -20], index, dtype='pint[MW]') 
   # prices
   energy_price = pd.Series([60, 70, 65], index, dtype='pint[Eur/MWh]')
   risk_premium = pd.Series([5, 5, 5.5], index, dtype='pint[Eur/MWh]')

   # nested pf-lines
   volume = pf.PfLine({'existing': existing_customers, 'churn': expected_churn})
   price = pf.PfLine({'energy': energy_price, 'premium': risk_premium})

   union1 = volume | price.flatten()
   union1
   # --- hide: start ---
   print(repr(union1))



--------------
Set timeseries
--------------

Sometimes we may want to replace one part of a ``PfLine``, while keeping the others the same. For this we can use the ``.set_w()``, ``.set_q()``, ``.set_p()`` and ``.set_r()`` methods. These methods accept float values, ``pint.Quantity`` objects, and ``pandas.Series``, and return a new ``PfLine`` with the selected information replaced. 

The returned portfolio lines are flattened.

It is also possible to set a price-only, volume-only, or reveue-only portfolio line as the price, volume, or revenue; for this we use the ``.set_price()``,  ``set_volume()``, and ``set_revenue()`` methods.

.. _pflinehedging:

-------
Hedging
-------

In general, hedging is the act of reducing the exposure to certain risks. In power and gas portfolios, it is common for customers to pay a fixed, pre-agreed price for the volume they consume. By sourcing volume on the market as soon as a customer is acquired, the open positions can be kept small, effectively hedging the portfolio's profit against market price changes.

A perfect hedge would be to buy the exact offtake volume of a portfolio in every delivery period at the shortest time-scale, e.g., days for gas and (quarter) hours for power. This is usually not possible, and hedging is done with standard products instead. Depending on the time until delivery, these may be month, quarter, or year bands; in power these exists for base, peak, and offpeak. 

Using the ``.hedge_with()`` method, the volume timeseries in a portfolio line is compared with a price timeseries, and the corresponding portfolio line in standard products is returned. Parameters specify the forward price curve, the length of the products (e.g. months), the hedge method (volume hedge or value hedge), and whether to use a base band or split in peak and offpeak values.

.. exec_code:: 

   import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024-04-01', '2024-06-01', freq='H', inclusive='left')
   offtake = pf.PfLine(pf.dev.w_offtake(index))  # mock offtake volumes
   prices = pf.PfLine(pf.dev.p_marketprices(index)) # mock market prices
   # Create hedge
   hedge = offtake.hedge_with(prices, 'vol')
   # Compare the two:
   (offtake | prices).plot()
   hedge.plot()
   # --- hide: start ---
   (offtake | prices).plot().savefig('docs/savefig/fig_offtake.png')
   hedge.plot().savefig('docs/savefig/fig_hedge.png')

.. image:: ../savefig/fig_offtake.png
   
.. image:: ../savefig/fig_hedge.png
 

----------------
Peak and offpeak
----------------

For portfolio lines with (quarter)hourly data, the ``.po()`` method splits the values in peak and offpeak. We can again specify if we want monthly, quarterly, or yearly values.

.. exec_code::
   
   # --- hide: start ---
   import portfolyo as pf, pandas as pd
   index = pd.date_range('2024-04-01', '2024-06-01', freq='H', inclusive='left')
   offtake = pf.PfLine(pf.dev.w_offtake(index))  # mock offtake volumes
   # --- hide: stop ---
   # continuation of previous code example
   offtake.po()
   # --- hide: start ---
   print(repr(offtake.po()))

NB: be cautious in using the output of this method. The values in the "sub-dataframes" do not apply to the entire time period, so the usual relations (e.g. energy = power * duration) do not hold if the duration of the entire time period is used. For convenience, the relevant duration (of only the peak or only the offpeak hours) is included in the dataframe.
