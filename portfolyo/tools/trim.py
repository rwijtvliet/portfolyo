def index(i: pd.DatetimeIndex, freq: str) -> pd.DatetimeIndex:
    f"""Trim index to only keep full periods of certain frequency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    i : pd.DatetimeIndex
        The (untrimmed) DatetimeIndex
    freq : {{{', '.join(tools_freq.FREQUENCIES)}}}
        Frequency to trim to. E.g. 'MS' to only keep full months.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DatetimeIndex
        Subset of ``i``, with same frequency.

    Notes
    -----
    For shorter-than-daily indices, it is assumed that the index starts with a full day.
    I.e., the time-of-day of the first element is assumed to be the start time for the
    day-or-longer delivery periods. (E.g., if the index has hourly values and starts with
    "2020-04-21 06:00:00", it is assumed that a delivery day is from 06:00:00 (incl)
    until 06:00:00 (excl).)
