    """Standardize a series or dataframe.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fr : pd.Series or pd.DataFrame
    force : {'aware', 'agnostic'}, optional (default: None)
        Force returned frame to be timezone aware or timezone agnostic. Timezone aware
        means that the index has a timezone, like UTC or Europe/Berlin. Timezone agnostic
        means that the index shows wall time with 24h days without DST. If None: keep
        timezone as-is.
    bound : {'left', 'right'}, optional (default: 'left')
        If 'right', specifies that input timestamps are right-bound, and will change to
        left-bound.
    tz : str, optional (default: None)
        Timezone. Timezone to convert the values into and/or to interpret values in.
        - If ``force`` is None, this argument is ignored.
        - If the index is timezone agnostic and ``force`` is 'aware', the frame values
          are interpreted as being in this timezone. E.g., if 'Europe/Berlin', the final
          Sunday in March already has 23h; all that's needed is to set the timezone.
        - If the index is timezone agnostic and ``force`` is 'agnostic', the same is
          done, but followed with a conversion to timezone-agnostic frame.
        - If the index is timezone aware and ``force`` is 'aware', the values are
          converted to timezone ``tz``. See parameter ``floating``.
        - If the index is timezone aware and ``force`` is 'agnostic', this argument is
          ignored.
    floating : bool, optional (default: True)
        If ``force`` == 'aware': how to convert to ``tz`` if ``fr`` has other timezone.
        Keep local time (``floating`` == True) or keep universal time (``floating`` ==
        False). Ignored if ``force`` == 'agnostic' or None.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series | pd.DataFrame
        Same type as ``fr``, with a left-bound DatetimeIndex, a valid frequency, and
        wanted timezone.

    Notes
    -----
    It is assumed that we are dealing with "time-averable" data, such as values in [MW]
    or [Eur/MWh]. This is especially important when converting daily (and longer) values
    between a tz-agnostic context and a tz-aware context with DST-transitions. The value
    on a 23-hour day is used as-is when convertintg to a 24-hour day.
