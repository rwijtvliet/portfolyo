(hourly means: hourly or shorter)
(daily means: daily or longer)

We consider 3 types of gapless datetime indices:
A: tz-aware indices. These are never ambiguous, and a freq can always be set.
B: tz-naive indices without DST. These always have 24h/day, and a freq can always be set.
C: tz-naive indices for a location with DST. There is a problem if an index includes the
DST-transition:
- When representing hourly values, there are (correctly) skipped or doubled timestamps.
However, the freq cannot be inferred.
- When represinging daily values, all timestamps are present and a freq can be inferred.
However, not all timestamps have the correct duration (e.g., 24h when day actually has
23h or 25h).

Depending on the use case, we want to work only with type A, or only with type B. But we
must accept all types as input and be able to convert to either type A or type B.

Conversions:
A -> A (different tz). Not always possible. If it is possible, it is a lossless conversion.
        Always possible for quarterhourly. Usually possible for hourly (if difference in
        UTC-offset is whole number of hours). Not possible for daily (because old periods
        do not line up with new timestamps).
        NB: if a floating conversion is wanted (e.g., the 12:00 value in timezone 1 must
        be mapped onto the 12:00 value in timezone 2), go via A -> B -> A.
B -> A. Always possible. If A has no DST, it is a lossless conversion. If has a DST,
        it is a lossing conversion: for hourly indices, we will omit/double some
        corresponding values, and for daily indices, we might need to change the
        corresponding values.
C -> A. Possible for hourly and daily (if belonging to same tz).
A -> B. See B -> A.
B -> B. No conversion.
C -> B. Go via C -> A -> B; timezone must be known.


Implementation difficulties: do we have a B or a C index?
. If it has a frequency, it can be:
. a type B.
. a type C with hourly values which happen to not include a DST-transition.
. a type C with daily values.
. If it has no frequency, it can be:
. a type B with gaps.
. a type C with gaps.
. a type C with hourly values which do include a DST-transition.
It's therefore hard to determine, which it is.

def force_tzaware(fr: NDFrame, tz: str, *, floating: bool = True) -> NDFrame:
    """Convert/set series or dataframe to a specific timezone.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fr : NDFrame
        Pandas Series or Dataframe with tz-aware or (standardized) tz-agnostic index.
    tz : str
        Target timezone.
    floating : bool, optional (default: True)
        Ignored if ``fr`` is tz-agnostic. How to handle conversion to *another*
        timezone.
        - True: move timestamp on universal time axis to same local time in target
          timezone.
          '2020-03-01 12:00+0530 Asia/Kolkata' --> '2020-03-01 12:00+0100 Europe/Berlin'
          Lossy conversion if source and target timezones do not both have a fixed UTC-
          offset.
        - False: fix timestamps on universal time axis and find new local time in target
          timezone.
          '2020-03-01 12:00+0530 Asia/Kolkata' --> '2020-03-01 07:30+0100 Europe/Berlin'
          Conversion in many cases (e.g. daily values and longer) impossible as there is
          no 1-to-1 relation between source and target timezones.

    Returns
    -------
    NDFrame
        With tz-aware index.

    Notes
    -----
    The frequency of ``fr``'s index must be set (or inferrable). Common reasons why this
    is not possible:
    * Timestamps are missing from the index; add them with ``fr.resample().asfreq()``
    * The index is not tz-aware but implies a certain timezone; localize it with
      ``fr.tz_localize()``.

    It is assumed that we are dealing with "time-averable" data, such as values in [MW]
    or [Eur/MWh]. This is especially important when converting daily (and longer) values
    between a tz-agnostic context and a tz-aware context with DST-transitions; see the
    first example:
    * Daily values: 10 [MW] on 2020-10-25 (which has 24h in a standardized context) is
      converted into 10 [MW] on 2020-10-25 in the Europe/Berlin timezone (which has
      25h). Note that this conversion is probably not what we want if we have values in
      units of [MWh] or [Eur].
    * Hourly values: a value of 4 [MW] on 2020-10-25 02:00-03:00 (standardized) is
      duplicated to TWO values of 4 [MW] each in the Europe/Berlin timezone. Note that
      this conversion is probably what we want, regardless of the unit.
