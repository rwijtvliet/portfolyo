    """Create function to identify which timestamps in an index are peakhours and which are offpeak.

    Parameters
    ----------
    peak_left : dt.time, optional (default: midnight)
        Start time of peak period on days that have a peak period (left-bound, incl).
    peak_right : dt.time, optional (default: midnight of following day)
        End time of peak period on days that have a peak period (right-bound, excl).
    isoweekdays : Iterable[int], optional (default: Monday through Friday)
        Which days of the week have a peak period. (1=Monday, 7=Sunday)

    Returns
    -------
    PeakhourFunction
        That takes a DatetimeIndex input and returns a Series of booleans with that index,
        indicating for each timestamp if it is part of the peak period or not.

    Notes
    -----
    The values for ``peak_left`` and ``peak_right`` are used to determine the longest
    frequency for which the function makes sense. This is the longest frequency of which
    the timestamps are either entirely peak or entirely offpeak.
    - If one of them does not fall on the full hour (but on a full quarter-hour), e.g.
      07:30, the function can only be used for indices with quarterhour frequency (as
      there are some hours which are partly peak and partly offpeak).
    - If they are both full hours, e.g. 08:00, the function can be used for indices with
      quarterhourly and hourly frequency.
    - If they are both None, each day is entirely peak or entirely offpeak. The function
      can be used for indices with a daily frequency or shorter.
